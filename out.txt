AFWCF Overview - FY 2025 President’s Budget (PB)  Air Force Working Capital Fund  
Budget Overview  
Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 President’s Budget (PB)  
 
Increasing lethality and improving readiness to prepare for the high -end fight is a primary objective of the Air Force 's FY 2025  
President’s Budget  (PB).  The Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) contributes to Air Force readiness through the depots ' 
skills to sustain  the AF 's organically maintained weapon systems and logistically manag e the supply chain's critical assets .  As 
a world -class organization , the AFWCF  responds rapidly  to customer needs on par with private sector defense firms with 
tremendo us flexibility to meet surge requirements.  
AFWCF Blue is the portion of the working capital fund  the AF manages  (see below in Activity Group Overview for additional 
details), therefore does not include Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF). AFWCF Blue  Cash ended FY 2023 at 
$1,088.6  million  and FY 202 4 and FY 202 5 are expected to  build cash and  remain within the upper and lower cash limits , 
ending FY 202 5 with $1, 730.8 million .  
Activity Group Overview  
The AFWCF Blue conducts business in two primary areas:  the Consolidated Sustain ment Activity Group  and the Supply 
Management Activity Group -Retail.  The Transportation Working Capital Fund  (TWCF), for which the Air Force assumed 
responsibility for cash oversight in FY 1998, is part of this submission.  However, United States Transportation Command 
(USTRANSCOM), rather than the Air Force, has management responsibility for TWCF 's day-to-day operations.

AFWCF Overview - FY 2025 President’s Budget (PB)  Air Force Core Strategic Capabilities  
In support of Air Force core functions, the AFWCF activities provide maintenance services, weapon system parts, base and 
medical supplies, and transportation services.  The working capital funds are integral to the readiness and sustainability of our 
air, space , and cyber assets and our ability to deploy forces worldwid e and across any theater to support  overseas operations 
and National Defense Strategy interests .  Maintenance depots provide equipment, ski lls, and repair services that keep force s 
operating worldwide.  Supply M anagement activities procure and manage inventories of consumable and r epairable spare 
parts that  support  all the force structure mission -ready.  USTRANSCOM is the single DoD manager for the Defense 
Transportation System (DTS) in peace and war.  Working capital fund activities, directly and indirectly,  provide warfighters the 
critical  services needed to meet global mission capability requirements.  
Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group  
The Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG)  mission  is supply management of reparable and consumable items  and 
maintenance services.  CSAG is managed under a Chief Executive Officer structure.  The Air Force Material Command 
(AFMC) Commander (AFMC/CC) is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  The AFMC  Director of Logistics (HQ AFMC/A4) serves 
as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) , and the AFMC Director of Financial Management (HQ AFMC/FM) is the Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO).  The Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC), one of the six centers within AFMC, directs both CSAG divisions' 
day-to-day operat ions.  The activity operates with two divisions:  Maintenance and Supply.  
Maintenance Division  
The CSAG -M repairs weapon systems and spare parts to ensure readiness in peacetime and to provide sustainment for 
overseas operations.  The division enhances readiness by efficiently and economically repairing, overhauling, and modifying 
aircraft, engines, missiles, components and software to meet customer demands.  The CSAG -M depots have unique skills 
and equipment req uired to support and overhaul both new, complex components and aging weapon systems.  During 
contingencies, the depots can surge repair operations and realign capacity to support the war fighter’s immediate needs.

AFWCF Overview - FY 2025 President’s Budget (PB)   
CSAG -M remains a fundamental element o f both readiness and sustainability by providing a cost -effective, rapid repair 
capability. CSAG -M repair and overhaul capabilities are accomplished by one of the six centers within the Air Force Materiel 
Command (AFMC), the Air Force Sustainment Center (A FSC) and its Air Logistics Complex (ALC) depots.  The division 
operates on funds received from its customers through sales of its services.   
Supply Division  
The CSAG Supply Division is responsible primarily for Air Force -managed, depot -level reparable spa res and consumable 
spares unique to the Air Force.  Reparable supply items are economically maintained through overhaul or repair.  Consumable 
supply items are consumed in use or discarded when worn out or broken because they cannot be repaired economicall y.  In 
addition to management of these inventories, the CSAG Supply Division provides a wide range of logistics support services 
including requirements forecasting, item introduction, cataloging, provisioning, procurement, repair, technical support, data  
management, item disposal, distribution management, and transportation.  
The CSAG Supply Division works to reduce the impact of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages 
(DMSMS) and other obsolescence issues associated with aging aircraft flee ts.  Due to fleet age and utilized antiquated 
technology, the number of parts without qualified manufacturing or repair source is expected to continue to be a problem.   To 
address these DMSMS and other obsolescence issues, the CSAG Supply Division re -engin eers parts which can no longer be 
produced or repaired.  The CSAG Supply Division also proactively identifies parts for which availability is at risk due to DM SMS 
issues, taking appropriate action to minimize adverse impact to weapon system readiness.

AFWCF Overview - FY 2025 President’s Budget (PB)  Supply Management Activity Group –Retail  
The Supply Management Activity Group -Retail (SMAG -R) manages approximately  2.0 million inventory items , including 
weapon system spare parts, medical -dental supplies and equipment, and other supply items used in non -weapon system 
applications.  The Air Force SMAG -R is a critical component in combat readiness by procuring materiel and makes  spares 
available to authorized retail customers.  The activity operates with three divisions:  General Support, Medical Dental, and  the 
Air Force Academy.  The Medical Dental Division inventory includes a War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Stockpile.  WRM provides 
initial warfighting capability until re -supply lines sustain wartime demands for medical and dental supplies and equipment.  
The SMAG -R provides a wide range of logistics support services , including requirements forecasting, item introduction, 
cataloging, provisioning, procurement, repair, technical support, data management, item disposal, distribution management, 
and transportation .  Inve ntories are an integral part of SMAG -R and are maintained by each of the divisions supporting  
customer requirements.  The SMAG -R objective is to replenish stock s and provide supplies to customers on time  within 
customer funding constraints while mai ntaining fund solvency.  
Transportation Working Capital Funds  
 
USTRANSCOM’s mission includes providing air, land, and sea transportation for the DoD with a primary focus on wartime 
readiness. USTRANSCOM’s $ 9.6 billion budget provides synchronized transporta tion and sustainment, making it possible to 
project and maintain national power where needed, with the greatest speed and agility, the highest efficiency, and the most 
reliable level of trust and accuracy.  The assigned Unified Command Plan tasks are execu ted through three component 
commands (U.S. Army’s Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift 
Command (MSC), and U.S. Air Force’s Air Mobility Command (AMC)) and one major subordinate command (Joint Enabling 
Capabilities Command (JECC)).  This joint team of transportation components provides mobility forces and assets for a 
seamless transition from peace to war.  USTRANSCOM is always ready to meet the strategic mobility needs of the nation.  A 
brief description of the role of each Transportation Component Command follows:

AFWCF Overview - FY 2025 President’s Budget (PB)  AMC is the single manager for air mobility by providing airlift, air refueling, special air mission, and aeromedical evacuati on for 
U.S. forces.  AMC also supplies forces to theater commands t o support wartime tasking.   
MSC supports the nation by providing marine transportation to satisfy DoD sealift requirements, which includes delivering 
supplies and conducting specialized missions across the world’s oceans.  
SDDC provides global surface depl oyment and distribution services to meet the nation’s objectives.  
USTRANSCOM’s Component Commands provide the critical link to the Services’ core competencies in organizing, training, 
and equipping forces.  They provide lines of communication to the Servic es, ensuring assets are available when needed for 
the transition from peace to war.  The surge from peacetime sustainment to a massive deployment of people and material in 
support of Overseas Operations is an example of USTRANSCOM’s ability to execute the mission.  USTRANSCOM’s 
successes result from the synergy of military and commercial lift (air, land, and sea), air refueling, port operations, and a float 
prepositioning - all requiring the team efforts of the Commander’s Staff and the components.  Together  with its components 
and national partners, USTRANSCOM is building a truly seamless, end -to-end defense transportation enterprise.

AFWCF Overview - FY 2025 President’s Budget (PB)  Air Force Initiatives   
AFSC continues to evaluate supply chain and maintenance processes to improve weapon system and equipment availability 
and to deliver customer support with increased velocity.  Sustained emphasis is on cost control in order to provide the best 
value to the customer.   
 
AFSC is pursuing alternative manufacturing technologies, additive manufacturing, establishing a reverse engineering and 
manufacturing framework to rapidly solve availability issues derived from DMSMS, supply chain risk, and obsolescence 
challe nges.  They are modernizing spares requirements planning to optimize inventory, and a multitude of other initiatives 
aimed at streamlining the supply chain process.  
 
 
AFSC’s Maintenance efforts are contributing to Air Force readiness and sustainability by providing a cost -effective, rapid repair 
capability. CSAG -M seeks to provide continuous core Air Force depot capability to retain in -house sources of technical 
competence; to continue to refine methods which enable the more efficient use of resources such as partnering with private 
industry, employing government owned/contractor operated facilities and augmenting in -house operations; and to find 
innovative ways to decrease flow days for systems and components, increase parts availability to the repair line,  and control 
material costs through process reviews and adoption of commercial practices and engineering standards.  
 
Direct Appropriations  
In FY 20 23, AFWCF received $ 80.4 million in direct appropriation for Medical Dental WRM requirements. In FY 202 4 Air Force 
requested  $83.6 million and in  FY 202 5 Air Force requests  a total of $86.9 million in direct appropriations  supporting  Medical 
Dental WRM requirements .

The methodology for calculating cash requirements consists of four 
elements: rate, range  of operations , risk mitigation, and reserves 
(all of which are colloquially  known  the 4Rs  in the AFWCF ).

  The Rate of Disbursements  for the AFWCF Blue FY 2025 PB was determined by dividing the total disbursements by the 
number of expected collection cycles for each division. The AF Blue collection cycles is a weighted average of all divisions  
rounded to nearest whole number. The weighting  is based on the total disbursements.  
The Range of Operations  is the difference between the lowest and highest planned monthly cash estimate plus one -half of 
the rate of disbursement at the sub -activity group level. The AF Blue range is the sum of the sub -activity groups range. In FY 
2025, the projected rate of disbursement is $733.2 million, and the lower range is $825.1 million. The upper range is $2,239.3 
million. The difference between the two ranges  results in $1,414.2 million as the basic operating r ange.  
AFWCF Blue Risk mitigation  addresses cash variability associated with unknown external variables and both day -to-day and 
seasonal volatility inherent to AFWCF operations. Historically customer demand is depressed during the first five months of 
the F iscal Year, negatively impacting cash balances. This demand is further exacerbated by external stressors such as 
continuing resolution authority.  This cyclical phenomenon occurs annually during the beginning of the fiscal year and poses 
risk of insolvency if limits are set too conservatively. During the last four to five months of the fiscal year customer dema nd and 
revenues typically inc rease to their highest levels. Risk mitigation is critical to AFWCF operations because it buffers low cash 
during the first five months of the next fiscal year. To mitigate seasonal volatility, we calculated the standard deviation f rom the 
mean for four ye ars of historical disbursements data (FY 2020 – FY 2023). One standard deviation for this data is $106.6 
million. In a normal distribution 68 percent of all data values lie within one deviation. The standard deviation value used f or FY 
2025 is based on thr ee standard deviations and encompasses 99 percent of all data values minimizing the execution year risk. 
The reason three standard deviations were used for FY2025 is to ensure the cash lower limit is sufficient to pay average 
amount disbursed per collectio n cycle. This will result in a corresponding decrease in cash. Therefore, three standard 
deviations or $319.8 million is factored in for operational volatility to mitigate risk of insolvency to the fund.  
Cash Reserves are held for cash balances that will b e paid out in future cycles and late in the current cycle. The first category 
is Accumulated Operating Results (AOR) returned/recovered to or from customers through annual rates. The second reserve 
supports unliquidated obligations of the MDD’s  direct appropriation for WRM.  No AOR return is held. The AOR retention for 
FY 2025 is $454.1 million, and is comprised primarily of GSD, CSAG -S and CSAG -M. The unliquidated appropriation amount 
for MDD  WRM program is $51. 1 million.

Budget Overview  
Fiscal Year (FY) 202 5 President’s Budget  (PB) 
 
 
The mission of the Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group ( CSAG ) is supply management of reparable and consumable 
items , and maintenance services .  Reparable supply items are economically  maintained through overhaul or repair.  
Consumable supply items are consumed in use or discarded when worn out or broken because they cannot be repaired 
economically.  CSAG Maintenance Division  (CSAG -M) and Supply Di vision (CSAG -S) services are executed under the Air 
Force Sustainment Center (AFSC)  within the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)  structure described in the Air Force 
Working Capital Fund ( AFWCF ) Overview.  With supply chain management and depot maintenan ce functions in one center, 
AFSC  analyze s and develop s sustainment -wide procedures, processes, and metrics with the ultimate  goal of increasing 
availability, capability, and affordability.  This construct supports one of the Air Force’s distinctive capabilities, Agile Combat 
Support, providing greater ability to posture for additional workload.  It also preserves the viability of de pot maintenance and 
the supply chain  capabilities .  
Maintenance Division  
The CSAG -M repairs weapon systems and spare parts to ensure readiness in peacetime and to provide sustainment for 
overseas operations .  The division enhances readiness by efficiently and economically repairing, overhauling, and modifying 
aircraft, engines, missiles, components,  and software to meet customer demands.  The CSAG -M depots have unique skills 
and equipment required to support and overhaul both new, complex components and agi ng weapon systems.  During 
contingencies, the depots can surge repair operations and realign capacity to support the war fighter’s immediate needs.   
CSAG -M remains a fundamental element of both readiness and sustainability by providing a cost -effective, r apid repair 
capability. CSAG -M repair and overhaul capabilities are accomplished by one of the six centers within the AFMC, AFSC

    CSAG Overview  CSAG Initiatives  
Individual processes are being modernized within CSAG.   AFSC continues to evaluate  supply chain and maintenance 
processes to improve weapon system and equipment availability and to deliver customer support with increased velocity.  
Continual emphasis is on cost control in order to provide the best value to the customer.   
AFSC strives to precisely define material re quirements with respect to aging aircraft.  Numerous problems exist with aging 
aircraft, such as first-time failures, loss of suppliers, Diminishing Manufacturing Source and Material Shortages ( DMSMS ), 
etc.  To combat the aforementioned DMSMS issues and ot her supply chain challenges, the Air Force is fostering senior 
leader engagement through multiple forums:  
 Expanding collaborative forecasting efforts through enhanced  deep dive efforts  
 Expanding market research and source development capabilities,  
 Continu ally engaging with Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Air Force Contracting to streamline the purchase 
instrument process,  
 Participating in DMSMS working groups charged with identifying critical obsolescence issues.   
 Placing greater focus on current and proposed future technology trends  
 Continuous monitoring for obsolescence/end of life alerts and strategically placed obsolescence mitigation 
opportunities  
 
AFSC is pursuing alternative manufacturing technologies, additive manufacturing and establishment of a reverse 
engineering and manufacturing framework to rapidly solve availability issues derived from DMSMS, supply chain risk and 
obsolescence challenges.  It is modernizing spares requirements planning to optimize inventory and impleme nting a 
multitude of other initiatives aimed at streamlining the supply chain process.  
 
AFSC’s Maintenance efforts are contributing to Air Force readiness and sustainability by providing a cost -effective, rapid 
repair capability. CSAG -M seeks to provide continuous core Air Force depot capability to retain in -house sources of technical 
competence; to continue to refine methods which enable the more efficient use of resources such as partnering with private 
industry, employing government ow ned/contractor operated facilities and augmenting in -house operations; and to find

Budget Overview  
Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 President’s Budget (PB)  
 
 
The Air Force Supply Management Activity Group –Retail (SMAG -R) is comprised of three divisions: General Support 
Division (GSD), Medical -Dental Division (MDD), and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). SMAG -R manages 
~2.0 million inventory items including weapon system spare parts, medical -dental supplies and equipment, and other items 
used in non -weapon system applications. SMAG -R is a cri tical component in the support of combat readiness. It procures 
materiel and makes spares available to authorized customers. Within SMAG -R, MDD inventory includes a War Reserve 
Material (WRM) Stockpile.  
 
SMAG -R provides a wide range of logistics support se rvices including requirements forecasting, item introduction, 
cataloging, provisioning, procurement, repair, technical support, data management, item disposal, distribution management 
and transportation. Inventories are an integral part of SMAG -R and are m aintained by each of the divisions in support of 
customer requirements. The SMAG -R objective is to replenish inventories and provide supplies to customers in a timely 
manner within customer funding constraints, while maintaining fund solvency.  
 
Division Ov erviews  
 
GSD finances the Air Force retail inventory and issues requirements for all non -Air Force managed economic order quantity 
(EOQ) items other than those pertaining to peculiar medical, commissary, and fuels requirements. GSD items support 
installati on, maintenance, administrative functions, field and depot maintenance of aircraft, ground and airborne 
communication and electronic systems, and other sophisticated systems and equipment. Also included is initial outfitting of 
individual clothing items is sued to new recruits, organizational clothing items such as firemen’s protective over garments, 
‘clean room’ coveralls, air crew helmets, and chemical biological warfare protective over garments. This retail activity is 
accomplished at 233 Air Force instal lations throughout the world.  
 
USAFA finances the purchase of uniforms, uniform accessories, and miscellaneous commodities required by USAFA 
cadets during their four -year stay at the Academy. The customer base consists of approximately 4,000 cadets. USAFA

  SMAG –Retail Budget Overview  procures both distinctive uniforms and accessories from various manufacturing contractors and regular Air Force uniforms 
purchased through the Defense Logistics Agency.  
 
The Surgeon General of the Air Force is responsible for the overall management of MDD.  Nearly all peacetime customer 
orders come from Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) funded by the Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriation.  
 
In addition to the peacetime program, MDD is also responsible for purchasing and maintaining the inventory/asse ts funded 
by WRM appropriation. The medical WRM inventory is owned by MDD until it is needed for war fighter deployment or 
contingency operations, and it is then sold to the AF line and funds are collected. WRM inventory accounts for approximately 
96% of t otal MDD inventory at any given time.  
 
WRM / Direct Appropriation  
 
MDD’s WRM provides supplies and equipment vital to support forces in the full range of military operations for the first 30 
days of a contingency operation and provides force health protect ion materiel to all deploying Air Force Active, Reserve, 
and Guard personnel. Availability of this materiel ensures Air Force personnel can deploy as scheduled and the contingency 
operations can be conducted until re -supply lines are established and materi el is routinely received from the contiguous 
United States. A direct appropriation funds the establishment and sustainment of over 3,300 assemblages and Force Health 
Protection assets for 255 locations that are maintained in MDD until required to provide d irect support to the war fighters.  
 
Approximately one third of WRM pharmaceuticals must be replaced annually because of shelf life or emergence of newer, 
more effective treatments. Sustainment costs to replace expiring materiel will continue to increase d ue to additional Unit 
Type Codes (UTCs) fielded into the WRM inventory, increased number of consumable items with expiration dates and 
manufacturers reducing the shelf life as new products enter the market.  Medical equipment requires constant upgrade to 
maintain the medical standard of care for required deployable capability. New technology allows for replacement of 
equipment with smaller, more proficient models which often drives a change in other supply requirements. Periodic 
modernization of WRM ensures  clinical and operational relevance of the UTC based on changes in clinical practice 
guidelines, medical technology, threat and operational environment and operational maneuver concepts.

  SMAG –Retail Budget Overview  SMAG -R Retail Customer Base  
 
SMAG -R generates revenue from sales of  various supplies to a diverse customer base.  Primary SMAG -R customers are 
Air Force Major Commands (including Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard), Foreign Military Sales, Army, Navy, 
Defense Health Program, non -DoD activities, and other working cap ital activities, such as Air Force Consolidated 
Sustainment Activity Group –Maintenance Division.  
 
SMAG -Retail Financial and Performance Summary  
 
The table on the next page provides revenue and expense data for the SMAG -R division. Revenue and expenses in F Y 
2023 reflect an Accumulated Operating Result (AOR) of $ 769.3  million and primarily due to GSD. Expenses increase 
primarily driven by GSD projected workload in FY 2024 and FY 2025 in Flying Hour Program (FHP) and increasing 
inflation factors. Revenue incr ease is consistent with increasing price change and customer requirements.  Expense and 
Revenue changes for USAFA and MDD are stable and in line with current customer requirements and historical data.  
SMAG -R AOR declines by $2 4.8 million in FY 2024 and by  $108.1 million in FY 2025 as GSD returns profits ending with a 
deferred AOR of $ 636.4 million. The deferred AOR reduces insolvency risk in GSD and the AFWCF overall and allows the 
program to preserve cash.  
 
Projected FY 2024 Unit Cost Rate (UCR) for SMAG -R is 1.01, and FY 2025 UCR is 1.02, slightly above normal 1.0 goals 
due to GSD deferred AOR.  
 
The WRM direct appropriation received is included in the Total Revenue and Expenses balances in all fiscal years. Other 
Adjustments (WRM) are completed so Net Op erating Result (NOR) reflect only results associated with the Operating 
Program, keeping WRM Program activity NOR neutral.

The FY 2023 SMAG -R ending cash balance increase d as collections from the Depots were received. FY 2024 and FY 2025 
decreases primarily driven by GSD returning profits through negative NOR. The lower operating range is driven by the GSD

Transportation Working Capital Fund  
Fiscal Year (FY) 20 25 Budget Analysis  
 
Background  
 
This submission provides justification for the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Transportation Working Capit al Fund (TWCF) 
budget.  USTRANSCOM submits the TWCF budget as a distinct subset of the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) budge t submission.  It reflects 
the cost authority needed to meet USTRANSCOM’s Unified Command Plan (UCP) mission. With global responsibilities and capabilit ies that transcend 
air, land, and sea, USTRANSCOM is uniquely postured to fulfill six specific responsibilities within the current  UCP that include: 1) the Mobility Joint 
Force Provider , 2) the Department of Defense ( DoD’s) Single Manager for Transportation , 3) the Joint Deployment and Distribution Coordinator (JDDC) 
for the Joint Deployme nt and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE) , 4) the D oD’s Single Manager for Patient Movement , 5) the provider for Joint Enabling 
Capabilities via the Joint Enabling Capabilities Command (JECC) (JECC is not part of the Working Capital Fund) , and 6) the D oD’s Sin gle Manager for 
Global Bulk Fuel Management and Delivery . 
 
USTRANSCOM and the broader JDDE are designed to project and sustain  combat power at a time and place of the Nation’s choosing.  The success 
of DoD’s power projection capability is contingent on thre e critical elements of USTRANSCOM’s organizational warfighting framework:  (1) Global 
Mobility Posture, the foundation of power projection; (2) Global Mobility Capacity, the conveyances and platforms that move troops, supplies, fuel, and 
equipment through g lobal transportation networks; and (3) Global Command, Control, and Integration,  the exercise of authority and direction to plan, 
coordinate, synchronize, and control operations at echelon .   
 
From day -to-day operations through wartime mobilization, commer cial nodes, rail infrastructure, trucks, aviation, and sealift capabilities are integral to 
USTRANSCOM’s ability to respond and scale to need. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) details the Department’s path forward into a decisive 
decade – from helping to protect the American people, to promoting global security, to seizing new strategic opportunities, and realizing and defending 
our democratic values.  
 
The Nation relies on USTRANSCOM to project an immediate and decisive f orce when needed and continues to adapt to the most complex security 
environment in recent history. USTRANSCOM provides our Nation’s leaders with various options while presenting multiple offens ive alternatives to 
thwart potential adversarial activities.  
 
Composition of Component Business Areas  
 
USTRANSCOM’s mission includes providing air, land, and sea transportation for the DoD with a primary focus on wartime readine ss. Our $ 9.6 billion 
budget provides synchronized transportation and sustainment, making i t possible to project and maintain national power where needed, with the greatest 
speed and agility, the highest efficiency, and the most reliable level of trust and accuracy .  Our assigned UCP  tasks are executed through three 
component commands U.S. Army’ s Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command  (SDDC) , U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift Command  (MSC) , and 
U.S. Air Force’s Air Mobility Command  (AMC)  and one major subordinate command (JECC).  This joint team of transportation components provides 
mobility forces and assets for a seamless transition from peace to war.  USTRANSCOM is always ready to meet the strategic mob ility needs of our 
nation.  A brief description of the role of each Transportation Component Command follows:

 AMC  is the single ma nager for air mobility by providing  strategic  airlift, air refueling, special air mission, and aeromedical evacuation for U.S. forces.  
AMC also supplies forces to theater commands to support wartime tasking.   
 
MSC  supports our nation by providing mari time transportation to satisfy DoD sealift requirements, which includes  delivering supplies and conducting 
specialized missions across the world’s oceans . 
 
SDDC  provides global surface deployment and distribution services to meet the nation’s objectives . 
 
Our Component  Commands provide the critical link to the Services’ core competencies in organizing, training, and equipping forces.  They provide lin es 
of communication to the Services, ensuring assets are available when needed for the transition from peace to  war.  The surge from peacetime 
sustainment to a massive deployment of people and material in support of overseas operations  is an example of our ability to execute our mission.  Our 
successes result from the synergy of military and commercial lift (air, l and, and sea), air refueling, port operations, and afloat prepositioning.  Together 
with its components and national partners, USTRANSCOM is building a truly seamless, end -to-end defense transportation enterprise.  
 
Despite concerted efforts to improve fina ncial transparency and reporting, USTRANSCOM has received six audit disclaimers of opinion. During fiscal 
year 2023, USTRANSCOM conducted an end to end review of TWCF and accounting operations to understand issues impacting remedia tion efforts. 
This analys is lead to a revised audit strategy across USTRANSCOM and the components.   
 
Global Bulk Fuel Management and Delivery  (GBFMD)  - Section 352, FY2022, National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) designated 
USTRANSCOM as the element responsible for bulk fuel management and delivery of the (D oD) on a global basis, beginning on 1 February 2023  and 
costs are incorporated in this submission .  
USTRANSCOM is  committed to improving the relocation process for military members and families. In support of the D oD reform  initiative, 
USTRANSCOM transitioned the Defense Personal Property Program (DP3) to a centralized acquisition approach with a single move manager.  By 
transitioning to a single move manager, Global Household Goods Contract (GHC) fundamentally restructures DoD’s relationship with the household 
goods moving industry to deliver the quality that service members, DoD employees, and their families deserve, and the account ability that Congress 
demanded.  
 
Capital funding continues to support system enhancements an d upgrades to embrace USTRANSCOM’s role as a global Combatant Command 
delivering national objectives in tomorrow’s dynamic security environment.   USTRANSCOM challenges its assumptions, accurately forecasts trends 
that will define the future operating envir onment and develops the technologies and ideas that maintain our Nation’s competitive advantage in 
transportation and logistics. Cyber resiliency and digital modernization initiatives will remain a top priority for the comma nd.  We continue to modernize 
our IT systems by not only taking advantage of cloud computing services but also through advancing our ability to manage data a s a strategic asset to 
advance decision making at all levels.

Revenue :  Revenue estimates include rate revenue, reimbursable revenue, Airlift Readiness Account, and Service Level Bills.  They are determined as 
follows:  
 
 Rate revenue : Derived by using approved rates multiplied by various workload measures (i.e., flying hours, ton miles, tons, pa ssengers , ship 
days, measurement tons, vehicles , etc. ). In most cases, TWCF rates recoup budgeted costs  and beginning A ccumulated Operating Results 
(AOR) , consistent with standard Working Capital Fund guidelines.  
 
 Reimbursable revenue: Includes commercia l airlift and sealift charters purchased by customers ( charged based on recovery of contract costs ).  
 
 Airlift Readiness Account (ARA):  As directed in the Do D FMR, AMC ’s channel airlift rates are set to compete with private sector rates  and do 
not cover the cost of the unique readiness requirements of military airlift operations.  The ARA recoups the difference between channel system 
operating costs and benchmarked rate revenue , plus/minus prior year channel losses/gains.  Starting in FY 2024 , charter rates are established  
to recover 100% of the cost of military charters  and no longer impacts the ARA . 
 
 Service Level Bill s (SLB) : Port Readiness , Traffic Management  and Global Bulk Fuel Management and Delivery . 
 
 Transactional Bill: Defense Personal  Property Program (DP3) .

The methodology for calculating cash requirements consists of four elements: rate, range, risk mitigation, and reserves (coll oquially, the 4Rs).    
 
 
 
 
 
FY 202 5 Rate of Disbursements  is the TWCF’s average amount disbursed per collection cycle. Range of Operations  is the highest and lowest 
expected cash level with $732 million as the basic operating range. Risk Mitigation  includes Contingency/Humanitarian Operations, current events, 
potential emerging “operational threats”, and support of initial unplanned operations until collections begin.  Cash Reserves  include Liability Reserves 
(cost of possible contract ter mination and carrier bankruptcy) and Continuity of Combatant Command (COCOM) Operations (Continuing Resolution 
Authority, government shutdown, sequestration).

Capital Investment Program (CIP)  
 
The CIP budget enables USTRANSCOM to build, adapt and maintain the Equipment, Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE), 
Telecommunications Equipment, Software Development, and Minor Construction required to conduct globally integrated mobility o perations , lead the 
broader Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), and provide enabling capabilities to project and sustain the Joi nt Force in support of 
national objectives.  
 
USTRANSCOM continues to challenge assumptions, accurately forecast trends that will define the future operating environment and develop the 
technologies to maintain our Nation’s competitive advantage in transportation and logistics. Current efforts include Consolid ate Air Mobility Planning 
System (CAMPS), Defense Personal Proper ty System (DPS), and Integrated Booking System (IBS).   
 
 CAMPS continues the agile acquisition approach to ongoing development and modernization of Airlift Requirements, Airlift Plan ning, Barrel 
Master, Iterative Planning, Enterprise Service Integration, a nd Mission Scheduling Service.   
 DPS continues to define, develop, test, and deploy capabilities using agile software methodology for the MilMove  prototype. Work continues 
as this program demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of a significant number of CONUS household moves.   
 IBS continues to transform into an agile suite of business services replacing the legacy system.  The development i ncludes migrating to the 
cloud with a process -model driven application. This will significantly reduce time to deliver system change requests and expedite solutions to 
meet user requirements, while also implementing new rates to support the Universal Servi ce Contract 9 (USC9) and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba 
Contracts.   
 Multiple programs are transitioning to a cloud environment and include the cost of shifting applications and big data to a cl oud environment.

This capability represents an array of capital equipment investment requirements that aligns with the overall Air Force strategic objectives for sustaining depot facilities and 
equipment.  Projects are in direct support of Aircraft, Missiles, Engines, Exchangeable, or Other Depot mission.  WSS investments are designed, scheduled, and installed in 
accordance with established Air Logistics Complex or Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group processes and priorities.  WSS projects support the maintenance 
mission requirements to sustain the existing organic industrial base, save dollars through increased productivity, and support customer requirements. The equipment, when 
replaced, upgraded, integrated, or combined into depot industrial operations, leads to efficiency and personnel safety; supports hazardous waste minimization and pollution 
prevention efforts; enhances product quality; and increases customer satisfaction in performing the Air Force mission.  Time sensitivity of projects to accommodate new or 
emerging workload capability and produce an acceptable end state is a critical factor in depot operations.  As such, programming and execution in this capability is essential as 
equipment requirements may change.  Documentation and project justification support are certified and maintained on file in accordance with the established guidance. $6M 
has been allocated for  Temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS) to accompany the ramp expansion to support the B-52 re-engine efforts.Narrative Justification:

An Economic Analysis was completed and is on file. EA waiver was obtained for the Ramp Expansion (MC) and temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS).
If facilities are not properly maintained or modernized based upon required depot workload, there will be work stoppages along with safety and security issues which affects 
weapon system availability. The minor construction that is required for new equipment setup will not be in place, thus severely impacting the depots’ ability to efficiently provide 
repair services and meet warfighter requirements. The B-52 fleet will undergo a major modernization effort in conjunction with PDM starting in FY25 requiring additional dock 
space at OC-ALC.  Current dock and ramp constraints are inadequate to support B-52 modernization efforts stressing the need for an expansion of the Ramp (Minor 
Construction) and the procurement of temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS).FY2025 FY2024 FY2023
This category includes an array of minor construction projects that allows flexibility in adapting to new and changing workloads.  Projects are smaller in scale (costing between 
$250,000 and $6,000,000) and are designed, scheduled, and constructed in accordance with Air Logistic Complexes' established priorities.  These projects support the depot 
maintenance, mission requirements, correct safety and health problems; improve productivity through quality of life improvement projects, improve depot flow days and support 
office and work space reorganizations.  In addition, MC projects provide construction required to install needed mission essential equipment and capital investment equipment.  
$5M of Minor Construction has been allocated for the concrete Ramp Expansion to accompany the Temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS) to support the B-52 re-engine efforts.Narrative Justification:

TCJ8-PC-262-001-Addendum 1 Signed 5 Oct 2017.  Economic Analysis will be updated with Addendum 2 to incorporate changes since last update.  An addendum for Airlift 2.0 was 
completed dated April 2016.
Without this investment, United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) will be unable to provide a Modeling and Simulation environment of interoperable, collaborative models 
and execution systems capable of providing accurate and consistent answers at the required breadth and depth of the Defense Transportation System (DTS) problem space. Without this 
investment, the integration of essential elements of analysis into a homogeneous, seamless, all-inclusive environment that ultimately represents the JDDE to the most effective and 
efficient level of fidelity possible is negatively impacted.
No license fees are associated with this investment.FY2025 FY2024 FY2023
AMP is an end-to-end modeling and simulation environment which supports joint collaborative programmatic analysis, planning execution analysis, experimental planning, execution 
analysis and peacetime operations. It allows mobility analysts to provide multi-level detailed analyses to support DoD mobility analytical studies. AMP serves as a platform to support 
futuristic programmatic studies and analyses such as mobility requirements studies and quadrennial defense reviews; it also has implications for component and Combatant Command 
planners and area of responsibility Directors of Mobility Forces. The current shortcomings in the AMP modeling and simulation capabilities include a lack of efficient communication 
between models and heuristic based optimization. Air Refueling Model supports the AMP’s ability to provide realistic scenarios to evaluate Operational Plans and to gauge risk to the 
mission due to gaps or seams in logistics support. The primary purpose of ARM is to model the impact of Air Refueling operations in the context of large, programmatic scenarios to 
determine the number of tankers required to support defense planning scenarios and impact of tanker operations.
This modeling and simulation federation provides integrated, authoritative modeling, simulation, stochastic optimization, and analysis tools for effective and efficient warfighter power 
projection and sustained long range planning. Modeling enhancements of Intermodal Operations, Ammunition Distribution, Inland Waterways Routing, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) 
terminals, and improved routing schedule will support DoD's analytic agenda for current and future programmatic studies. These modeling enhancements will provide greater insight and

Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) is Headquarters' Air Mobility Command (HQ AMCs) Command and Control (C2) planning and scheduling system that provides 
mobility mission planners with an integrated view for airlift and air refueling requirements management, planning, and scheduling of AMC/Mobility Air Forces (MAF) air mobility resources to 
support peacetime, contingency, humanitarian, and wartime operations. CAMPS provides separate unclassified and classified requirements, planning and scheduling capabilities, and also 
provides advanced user capabilities for operational planning and allocation management. CAMPS provides a joint capability to gather and manage mobility requirements for Special 
Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM), and intra-theater and channel requirements. The capability is used extensively in Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility at this time. 
CAMPS will continue to maintain the system and upgrade as required following the requirements approved under the MAF C2 Framework Capabilities Document (CDD).
CAMPS provides USTRANSCOM & HQ AMC's mission planners and schedulers with integrated, automated tools they require to manage and prioritize mobility requirements and to 
analyze, plan, and schedule mobility missions to meet airlift requirements. These tools will optimize the use of scarce Defense Transportation System airlift assets by: reducing empty or 
low cargo weight missions, reducing the number of supplemental contract airlift required, providing timely and accurate contingency support through rapid and efficient planning tools, 
roving asset tracking, and improving response to supported unified or combined command requirements. This capability will be provided in a more secure, user-friendly, and integrated 
environment. Allow users to optimize airlift planning and Air Refueling and publish mission schedules to achieve efficient and effective operations across given timeframes.Narrative Justification:

Contract deliverables include all software, release documentation, and system and security documents to be delivered at the completion of each sprint (software release).
The DPS Economic Analysis, certified July 2018, recommended the continued development of a personal property prototype (Alternative 2).  This alternative is less expensive than the 
Status Quo of continuing to maintain and develop the current legacy DPS Increment 3 system because Increment 4 provides significantly more qualitative benefits in customer support, 
scalability, security, compliance, and productivity improvements  leading to the most favorable cost to benefit ratio.

Development of MilMove is critical to transitioning capability to the optimal environment to lessen sustainment costs of the current infrastructure. MILMOVE provides 24-hour access 
connecting service members and civilians to their TSP and transportation office as they are moving their house hold goods in accordance with their permanent change of station orders. 
MilMove is the key government system supporting the Global Household Goods Contract (GHC) by interfacing and passing key data to the GHC system. MilMove help on-board military 
members and the invoicing processes led USTRANSCOM to continue the MilMove prototype into the GHC prime’s system while also generating the task order for government approval to 
authorize the GHC prime to perform the HHGs move. The MilMove system will support the GHC prime’s invoicing by generating an invoicing request based on the services provided with 
supporting documentation for the Third Party Payment System to pay the GHC prime.
Multi year development time and transition to increment 4 is essential to ensure uninterrupted support of permanent change of station moves in all DoD components.Narrative Justification:
